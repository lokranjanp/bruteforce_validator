# bruteforce_validator
My fun(illegal) attempt to cause DoS on a website in an attempt to validate a key value pair. 
I donot reccomend trying this from your personal computers/laptops. It can lead to IP traceback which 
can reveal your identity thus making you guilty of a DOS attack which is a criminal offence.

To test my code I used a dummy website along with a Virtual Linux Machine from a North American Server 
thus completely masking my identity.
